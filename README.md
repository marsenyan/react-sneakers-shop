# React Sneakers shop

Welcome to React Sneakers shop on GitHub!
This website's frontend is built using reusable and modular React components, making the codebase clean, maintainable, and highly scalable. I use React Router to handle client-side routing, enabling smooth navigation and URL-based navigation for a more natural browsing experience. Besides, website features a powerful search and filtering system, allowing users to find their desired sneakers quickly and efficiently.
